##NumericalAnalysis

### What It Is
Personal implementations of algorithms discussed in the book *Numerical Analysis 10th edition * by Richard L. Burden. 

### List of Functions/Things
+ Root (a1.py)
    + Bisection Method
    + Fixed Point Iteration
+ Derivative (a3.py, a4.py)
    + most basic method?
    + Three point formula. Forward difference formula used in the examples
+ Integration (a6.py)
    + Composite Trapezoid
    + Composite Simpson's Rule
    + Romberg's Method
+ Differential Equations - ODE's
    + Euler's Method (a6.py)
    + Taylor's Method of Order 2,4 (a7.py)
    + Modified Taylor's Method (a7.py)
    + Runge-Kutta Method of Order 4 (a7.py)
    + Runge-Kutta Method for Systems of Equations (a8.py)
+ Matrices
    + Gaussian Elimination - showing steps (a8n.py)
    + LU Decomposition of Crout Reduction (a9.py)

### Usage
Import a file and then just call the functions you want. Other functions start with 'p' followed by a number indicate examples. Specifically, they are examples in the book. Some come with page numbers.
